1. Genres: Physics to Meta
   - Ultimately general purpose
   - Call it AGI
2. [Modes](https://www.economist.com/subscriber-events/a-conversation-with-openais-sam-altman-and-microsofts-satya-nadella-hub): Epistemology
   - See
   - Hear
   - Talk
   - `Voice`
   - [Notes](https://hub.jhu.edu/2024/02/20/artificial-intelligence-analyzes-doctors-notes/)
   - Reasoning
     - 1993: Bill Gates: information at your fingertips
     - 2023: Satya Nadella: experts at your fingertips
3. Qualities: Ontology
4. History: Identity
   - Reverence
   - Inference
   - Deliverence
5. Voicings: Time
   - Not the underlying model (i.e., inversions of the chord)
   - But its `usability` (i.e., voicings reflect limits of our fingers, hands, and ears)
   - Sam Altman believes ChatGPT is such as thing: at [5:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Guz73e6fw)/2:23:56
   - [RLHF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning_from_human_feedback): doesn't require much data, but its the juice that made ChatGPT as we know it today
   - Also note that the process shouldn't be a blackbox
   - [Transparancy of AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X15o2sG8HF4) and how it works is key in its future success
   - But this also means literacy in datascience and AI
   - You can't have `transparency` & `illetracy` at the same time
     
6. Pocket: Change
   - Emotion: from anxiety, engagement, flow, control to relaxation, boredom, apathy, etc
   - `Percentage` of tasks that GPT-X can do
   - Healthcare & Education
     - Personalized
     - Experts at fingertips
     - Scallable

1. Ideal Data
   - Simulation
   - Diversity
   - Power for individualized medicine
   - We need those tokens for simultaneous hypotheses   
2. WebApp
   - Fine-tuning by clinician
   - Makes decision in real time
   - iOS, Android?
   - Structure of manuscript not consistent with `Original contributions` to the Journal
     - Please review papers published in this journal for format
     - Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, References
     - Your subsections such as 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 must be removed and presented as paragraphs
   - This is a clinical journal targeting specialists
     - Do not give the reader a background on organ transplantation
     - Consider submitting your article to a methods journal
     - Or submit it here as a new manuscript (not resubmission) that adheres to the format and treats the reader as a specialist
     - Clinical, guidelines, and policy implications should shape the paper
     - No non-clinical acronyms should be used; these burden the clinical reader with new terms
     - Choice of methods: [AI vs. statistics?](https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMra2212850?articleTools=true)
       - Challenges at the interface of medical statistics and AI are:
         - Population inference vs. prediction
         - Generalizability
         - Reproducibility and interpretation of evidence
         - Stability and statistical guarantees
