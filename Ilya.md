1. Bottom: first input layer
2. Neuronetworks: parallel? layers
3. Top: last output layer
4. RLHF
5. Challenge: e.g. Wrestling, Gaming
6. Success
   - Consider the pixels that successfully recognize the human eye in a picture
   - Then the eye of a basketball player in a video
   - Representing these in a game demands high fidelity prediction at the pixel level and milliseconds
   - Very computationally demanding
