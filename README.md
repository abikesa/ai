2. Pentatonic: GPT-4 was trained in two stages. First, the model was given large datasets of text taken from the internet and trained to predict the next token (roughly corresponding to a word) in those datasets. Indeed, indeed. Patterns have a minimum of five nodes (many edges), analogous to the pentatonic scale; powerful mnemonic, or language model!

3. Diatonic: Second, human reviews are used to fine-tune the system in a process called reinforcement learning from human feedback, which trains the model to refuse prompts which go against OpenAI's definition of harmful behavior, such as questions on how to perform illegal activities, advice on how to harm oneself or others, or requests for descriptions of graphic, violent, or sexual content

# Notes

Here's a table identifying which beers are considered "Trappiste":

| Name                | Trappiste |
|---------------------|-----------|
| Duval               | No        |
| Westmalle Dubbel    | Yes       |
| Westmalle Tripel    | Yes       |
| St. Bernadus Abt 12 | No        |

Westmalle Dubbel and Westmalle Tripel are the true Trappistes in this selection, adhering to the strict criteria that define Trappist beers, including being brewed within a Trappist monastery under the monks' supervision. Duval and St. Bernadus Abt 12, while exceptional beers in their own right, do not meet the criteria to be labeled as Trappiste.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Beers to classify
beers = [
    {"Name": "Duval", "Trappiste": "No"},
    {"Name": "Westmalle Dubbel", "Trappiste": "Yes"},
    {"Name": "Westmalle Tripel", "Trappiste": "Yes"},
    {"Name": "St. Bernadus Abt 12", "Trappiste": "No"}
]

# Creating a DataFrame
df_beers = pd.DataFrame(beers)

df_beers

```

# Critique

1. Can AI tell me if I'll like a certain beer? (Full range of modes of input: think cranial nerves, kinesthesia, etc)
2. And can AI handle hierarchical thinking? (My preferences are Bayesian-dynamic)
3. Grace! When will AI produce dance moves that are indinguishable from James Brown, Micheal, or Roller-Skating Usher?
