1. Ideal Data
   - Simulation
   - Diversity
   - Power for individualized medicine
   - We need those tokens for simultaneous hypotheses
   
     
2. Phenotype
3. WebApp
   - Fine-tuning by clinician
   - Makes decision in real time
   - iOS, Android?
   - Structure of manuscript not consistent with `Original contributions` to the Journal
     - Please review papers published in this journal for format
     - Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, References
     - Your subsections such as 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 must be removed and presented as paragraphs
   - This is a clinical journal targeting specialists
     - Do not give the reader a background on organ transplantation
     - Consider submitting your article to a methods journal
     - Or submit it here as a new manuscript (not resubmission) that adheres to the format and treats the reader as a specialist
     - Clinical, guidelines, and policy implications should shape the paper
     - No non-clinical acronyms should be used; these burden the clinical reader with new terms
     - Choice of methods: AI vs. statistics?
       - Challenges at the interface of medical statistics and AI are population inference vs. prediction, generalizability, reproducibility and interpretation of evidence, and stability and statistical guarantees. - Where Medical Statistics Meets Artificial Intelligence

   - Standard tokens from clinical practice
   - Two authors are from computer science and engineering
   - Why didn't they collaborate with clinicians from their institution?

1. I'm associate editor for Clinical Transplantation. Two peer-reviews are in for the paper I'm about to adjudicate. You critiques, edits, suggestions are welcome!
2. Title: Innovative Solutions for Organ Transplantation: MCNN-HELM, Risk Assessment, and Adaptive Allocation Algorithms
   - MCNN-HELM: non-standard acronymns must never be included in title or abstract
   - The "active voice" stating what was found or accomplished by the authors will engage the reader who seeks actionable points for clinical practice, guidelines, or policy
3. Abstract:
   - We leverage data 
   - Providers may use these inferences
      - To minimize waiting times
      - Also prioritize candidates at high-risk of death on waiting list
      - Generally maximize positive outcomes
   - Inferences:
      - risk assessment
         - medical risk
      - geographic analysis
         - shortest paths for donor identification
         - Which geographic area does this paper target?
            - India?
            - Or is it generalizable to any allocation system in the world?
            - What aspects of the simulation address this?
            - Maybe use an already published paper as a template
              - There are US papers focusing on Geography
              - Are there any papers from India on Geography
              - What really is new here?
        - Condense your content into simple clinical format: Apollonian surface
        - May provide supplements with technical details: Dionysian undercurrents
              
      - MCHH-HELM model
         - refines donor-recipient matching using deep learning techniques 
      - `novel` genetic algorithm-based optimal allocation strategy
         - compatibility
         - urgency
         - fairness
   - Simulation results (F1-scores):
      - Allocation efficiency: 0.97
      - Precision: ?
      - Recall: ?
      - Metric: F1-scores of 0.95, 0.97, 0.95
      - Fairness index: 0.92
   - Conclusion:
      - Sophisticated approach
      - Ethical considerations
      - Points way to empirical work
