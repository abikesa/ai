1. Living, deceased, intersection
2. History, exam, labs
   - Standard tokens from clinical practice
   - Two authors are from computer science and engineering
   - Why didn't they collaborate with clinicians from their institution?
   - Clarify if "supervised" multivariable regression $\propto$ sophistication
   - Or Sophistication $\sim$ AI
     
3. Usability
4. `Definable`

1. I'm associate editor for Clinical Transplantation. Two peer-reviews are in for the paper I'm about to adjudicate. You critiques, edits, suggestions are welcome!
2. Title: Innovative Solutions for Organ Transplantation: MCNN-HELM, Risk Assessment, and Adaptive Allocation Algorithms
   - MCNN-HELM: non-standard acronymns must never be included in title or abstract
   - The "active voice" stating what was found or accomplished by the authors will engage the reader who seeks actionable points for clinical practice, guidelines, or policy
3. Abstract:
   - We leverage data 
   - Providers may use these inferences
      - To minimize waiting times
      - Also prioritize candidates at high-risk of death on waiting list
      - Generally maximize positive outcomes
   - Inferences:
      - risk assessment
         - medical risk
      - geographic analysis
         - shortest paths for donor identification
      - MCHH-HELM model
         - refines donor-recipient matching using deep learning techniques 
      - `novel` genetic algorithm-based optimal allocation strategy
         - compatibility
         - urgency
         - fairness
   - Simulation results (F1-scores):
      - Allocation efficiency: 0.97
      - Precision: ?
      - Recall: ?
      - Metric: F1-scores of 0.95, 0.97, 0.95
      - Fairness index: 0.92
   - Conclusion:
      - Sophisticated approach
      - Ethical considerations
      - Points way to empirical work
